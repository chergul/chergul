### Hey 👋🏻,

As a teenager at school, I was the girl who was formatting to her own computer without any guides just by doing the research. It doesn’t matter I graduated from law school and practicing for around 10 years now.
Today, I took an opportunity and changed my career into a web developer.

I am writing codes, using libraries for my HTML to make a delicate website. Using JavaScript, jQuery for back-ends also for responsiveness. I do have adequate knowledge of object-oriented programming and databases as well. So you can fins some fun projects in my repo ✨
